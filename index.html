    <p>Hello Everyone in my cyberspace. Today, I made a Wolfenstein concept DOOM Style game on Python! I am going to mess with it a little longer and eventually might publish it! 
        I am so proud of learning how to make a game that looks so good and works well! But it was NOT easy!! I have been making this game since May of last year and had to learn new methods
        which is how I learned RayCasting. I also made a way to incorporate what I learned from Tic Tac Toe to make my game more secure and give me more control and security. I am now going to develop a 
        login screen and publish using xcode for mac only!
    </p>

    <p>Hello Everyone in my cyberspace! Remember the Tic Tac Toe game I made in December? Today I expanded on my knowledge and made the game more effective as for the developers which is me where I have total
        control of my game! Do not understand? I will explain! If a user attempts to login to my game whether they use the right password or not, I will be able to see on my terminal and control whether to terminate
        the game for them. Cool right! Also, whoever tries to login to my game, I recieve 24/7 feedback from the terminal of who entered my game at what time and whether the attempt was successful or not. This application was my first solo
        project and I made my game really fun and secure with full access to the developer which is me. I really like this experience because it shows me how professional applications keep their applications secure like me! If I forgot to say I Also
        added some more code where it tells me users IP address and Device HostName. 
    </p>

    <h3>December 1, 2022</h3>

    <p>Hello Everyone in my cyberspace! Today I made something unique than anything before! Today I made a Tic-Tac Toe game in python! It looks so much better than those other tic tac toe
        games on Apple Store! Also those games do not keep a rrecord of your score since there are no credientials. Luckily in mine, if a player has to leave on terminate the game, It will be saved 
        because I made another GUI which extends to my Tic-Tac_Toe class that requires a login to play and stores your score! I might release it on app store using xcode but need a spotter for 100 dollars!

        Hello Everyone in my cyberspace! My name is Krish Chauhan and this is my first blog online! I am not a blogger
        or anything like that. Actually, I never believed in that stuff before but i think it will be fun to try it out!
        The main reason I made this blog was to get an idea on web development! This is the first project or website I am
        making where I am making a blog or something! I hope this goes well and I learn new skills. My goal is that everytime
        I go back to my blog, it is more better and advanced than the last time. Lets see how good it is, if I do a good job,
        I might as well post it! The main reason I am making this is because I want to fill this with information on my achievements
        over the years and when i get older, I can look back and see all the accomplishments I have done.
    </p>
